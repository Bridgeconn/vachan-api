These APIs typically rely on vocabulary-based translation techniques and token replacement methods. They excel in handling very low-resource languages and languages that are closely related. Additionally, these APIs offer translation memory and context-aware suggestion capabilities, enhancing the quality and accuracy of translations. Whether it's cloud-based projects or local projects, these translation APIs can seamlessly integrate and support various implementation scenarios. Their versatility and capabilities make them valuable tools for enabling effective language translation in a wide range of applications.",

Vachan-mt-nllb APIs use NLLB(No Language Left Behind) models, sourced from meta for text translation. These models offer evaluated, high-quality translations among 200 languages, including low-resource languages. We are actively fine-tuning these models to support our specific use-cases. The Model Selection API retrieves nllb model details, Text Translation API supports translation into 200 languages and Document Translation API translates lists of sentences. Vachan-st-xlsr APIs are used to transcribe speech into text using machine learning models using ST-XLSR(Streaming Transformer -Cross-lingual Speech Recognition) model. It has the Model Selection API retrieves Speech to text and Language model details and The Transcribe API converts audio to text, supporting multiple languages. Current STT models use xlsr, with plans to transition to MMS models supporting 1000+ languages."

With its powerful query language, GraphQL enables declarative data fetching, eliminating the need for over-fetching or under-fetching. Initially implemented using Graphene, we are now migrating to the Strawberry library, ensuring access to the latest GraphQL advancements. It is hosted alongside our REST API services, this integration allows you to leverage the best of both worlds. While REST provides familiar GET, PUT, and POST endpoints, GraphQL empowers you with flexible and precise data retrieval."
